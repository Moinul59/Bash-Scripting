# Bash treats (( ... )) as arithmetic context.

# If your input strings happen to match exactly, Bash tries to resolve them as variables, 
# and string equality inside (( ... )) with == returns 1 (true) if they match â€” so the logic accidentally works for some cases.

# Bash internally treats any non-zero result in (( ... )) as true.

# Why it's not reliable or correct:

    # String comparison is undefined in (( ... )). Itâ€™s meant only for integers.

    # If the string canâ€™t be interpreted as a number, youâ€™ll get an error

# if (( name == username && pass == password ))
